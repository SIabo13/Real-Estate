                    John Doe, a third-generation realtor, is a Senior Sales Associate for Doe & Keller Real Estate. A
                    company his father Michael Doe and business partner Joseph Keller founded back in 1982. John’s hard
                    work, charisma, and true passion for the family business has helped his reputation as a qualified
                    realtor grow quickly. John has experience in all aspects in the field from first time home buyers to
                    selling in the luxury market.

                </p>
                <p>
                    As a New York native, John studied Economics and Finance through New York University. Before
                    starting in the family business John started a career early at an investment-banking firm on Wall
                    Street. His strong educational background, attractive competitive experience, and his command of
                    “numbers” makes him an asset across his range of clients.

                </p>
                <p>
                    As a Senior Sales Associate, John has worked his way up in the family business and cultivated the
                    market, servicing buyers, sellers, developers, renters, colleagues, and bankers with exceptional
                    respect, loyalty, and professionalism. His strong base of loyal repeat clients is the reason John
                    has been so successful for over twenty years in this incredibly competitive sales environment. John
                    leads, trains, and motivates his team to communicate with you better than none. Five words you can
                    count on from John Doe are love, integrity, commitment, passion, and fun.
